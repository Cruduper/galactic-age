## Technologies Used


* _JavaScript_
* _jQuery_
* _BootStrap_

* _npm_
* _Webpack_
* _Jest_
* _Babel_
* _ESLint_

## Description

_This was a weekly project at my coding bootcamp to test our ability to use classes, use a professional production environment with various npm packages, and use Test Driven Development._ 

_User can enter in their age (in Earth years) and personal information and then recieve what their age and life expectancy would be in terms of different planets' years._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone git repository to a local machine_
* _navigate to root folder of the project using command line_
* _use the '$ npm install' command to install necessary packages_
* _type in '$ npm run build' to build project_
* _type in '$ npm run start' command to open project in browser and start live server_

## Known Bugs

* _Because users age is rounded down to an integer, the results are also rounded down to the nearest integer, as this is usually how we express age in years, rather than with decimals._
* _Because the results are rounded down, some planets in our solar system with with long orbits are omitted, as the rounding implementation would cause gross inaccuracies._
